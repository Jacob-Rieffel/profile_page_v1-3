        </ul>

          <h1>Experience</h1>
          <h3>HTML5</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>My HTML experience dates back to early 2017. I'm very comfortable with HTML.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="emph">Javascript</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>I've been coding with Javascript since 2017 as well, but a little more off and on compared to HTML and CSS. I am currently reviewing Javascript content so I can be ready for future advanced projects. I have done many small projects that use Javascript.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>CSS3</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>My CSS knoweledge also started in 2017 at the same time as HTML and I've been styling with it comfortably ever since. I have done many projects that use CSS.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="emph">UX Design</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>My UX design experience is rather recent- starting in late September of 2021- and has since greatly improved my front end results. I have done few projects using UX design skills.  </li>
